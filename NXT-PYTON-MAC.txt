I installed NXT python on mac 10.8.1. 

NXT-Python's installation instructions are found here:
http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/wiki/Installation

NXT-Python requires either Bluetooth or USB to communicate with NXT.
I installed PyUSB-1.0.0a3
There are a number of ways to install PyUSB.

sudo easy_install pyusb
or 
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install pyusb 

Would have been the easier choices.
I downloaded pyusb-1.0.0a3 and installed with
sudo python setup.py install

At this point, you should be done. 
BUT YOUR NOT.
The error I recieved was "No backend available"

I then installed the LEGO Fantom Driver, and Pyfantom.
And still, it didn't work. After searching mailing lists:
The fix was to install newer libusb.
(I think it must be newer than libusb-1.0.0-a3) 
I downloaded the latest libusb-1.0.9
and installed with a simple:
./configure
make
sudo make install

Now NXT-Python is working.
